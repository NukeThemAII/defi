# WORK_LOG

## Session 2025-10-22 15:11
**Goal:** Initialize the Next.js scaffold and baseline tooling per project spec.
**Done:** Created Next.js app via create-next-app, copied project docs, added `.env.example`, installed core deps (Vaults SDK, wagmi, RainbowKit, React Query, Recharts, Prisma, Tailwind), switched to pnpm, pinned Next.js/React to 15.5.6/18.2.0 for compatibility, and applied Prisma schema with initial migration.
**Findings / Decisions:** Latest create-next-app defaults to Next 16/React 19, but wagmi peer deps prefer React 18; pinned framework packages to 15.5.6/18.2.0 and aligned TypeScript types. Continuing with pnpm for package management.
**Bugs / Blockers:** None.
**Next Steps:** Build Vaults and on-chain data libs, wire Prisma access patterns, and start implementing API routes `/api/vaults` and `/api/summary`.

## Session 2025-10-22 15:42
**Goal:** Implement data access layer for Vaults.fyi & Base on-chain reads, then expose `/api/vaults` and `/api/summary` endpoints.
**Done:** Added tracked-vault config, caching Vaults.fyi wrapper (`src/lib/vaults.ts`) with history helpers, built Base RPC helper library (`src/lib/onchain.ts`) with ERC-20/4626 balance + USD conversion, created projection math utilities, and shipped App Router handlers for `/api/vaults` (with optional history) and `/api/summary` (blended APY + wallet projections). Updated docs/env example for optional `BASE_RPC_URL`.
**Findings / Decisions:** Vault lookups key off vault names via detailed list to avoid hardcoding addresses; caching keeps repeated API hits down. Wallet summaries assume USD price from Vaults.fyi asset feed; added converter helper for easier reuse.
**Bugs / Blockers:** ESLint flat config still unhappy with plugin resolutionâ€”need to revisit config wiring after finishing core features.
**Next Steps:** Finish lint config cleanup, expand API surface (`/api/vault/[network]/[address]`, snapshots), and begin integrating Prisma persistence + background jobs.

## Session 2025-10-22 16:10
**Goal:** Expand backend surface (detail, wallet, snapshots, alerts) and stabilize lint tooling.
**Done:** Replaced legacy eslint-config-next wiring with flat config powered by `typescript-eslint` + `@next/eslint-plugin-next`, added Prisma helper (`src/lib/prisma.ts`) and platform sync utilities, implemented API routes for vault detail, wallet balances, snapshots (GET/POST), and alerts, and wired persistence via Prisma snapshots while syncing tracked platforms automatically. Added zod validation and aligned cached Vaults helpers to persist platform metadata. All lint checks now pass with stricter TypeScript rules.
**Findings / Decisions:** Custom flat config avoids incompatibilities in Next 15 scaffold and keeps React/Next rules without legacy `name` property issues. Snapshots leverage current Vaults.fyi metrics when manual payload omits fields, ensuring consistent data capture.
**Bugs / Blockers:** None; Prisma migrations already applied locally.
**Next Steps:** Build `/api/summary` persistence hooks (historical storage), implement `/api/alerts` integration with scheduled refresh job, and start UI wiring for new endpoints.

## Session 2025-10-22 16:32
**Goal:** Add automated tests for calculation utilities and document new workflows.
**Done:** Added Vitest config + npm scripts, implemented unit coverage for `src/lib/metrics.ts`, set `baseUrl` for path aliases, and updated README/testing docs. `pnpm test` + `pnpm lint` now clean.
**Findings / Decisions:** Vitest with V8 coverage keeps future CI simple and mirrors spec requirements. Maintaining tests alongside libs ensures regression checks for projection math.
**Bugs / Blockers:** None.
**Next Steps:** Integrate Prisma snapshot writes into `/api/summary`, stand up React Query hooks + UI pages, and schedule background refresh/alert job.

## Session 2025-10-22 16:44
**Goal:** Persist summary snapshots automatically and scaffold an hourly refresh worker.
**Done:** `recordSnapshotForSummary` helper centralizes Prisma writes, `/api/summary` now persists snapshots by default (opt-out via `persist=false`), snapshots POST reuses helper, and hourly cron worker (`pnpm refresh`) captures summaries + wallet balances while leveraging `DEFAULT_WALLET`. Documented new workflow in README and .env, added node-cron/tsx/dotenv deps, and kept lint/tests green.
**Findings / Decisions:** Default persistence ensures summary calls and the worker both enrich historical data with consistent logic; cron script designed for PM2/standalone usage.
**Bugs / Blockers:** None.
**Next Steps:** Expose refresh status in UI, wire React Query hooks for the new APIs, and plan alert delivery (email/webhook) pipeline.
